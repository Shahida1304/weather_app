#  Weather & Air Quality Dashboard


The **Weather & Air Quality Dashboard** is a full-stack data application built using **Python, Streamlit, and MySQL**.
It allows users to view **real-time weather**, **multi-day forecasts**, and **air quality information** for any location, while also maintaining a **search history database** with complete CRUD operations.

This project demonstrates **API integration, data visualization, database design, and interactive UI development** in a single, cohesive application.

##  Key Features

*  **Automatic Location Detection**
  Fetches current weather based on user’s approximate location (IP-based).

*  **Flexible Search**
  Search weather using:

  * City name
  * Zip code
  * Latitude & Longitude

*  **Current Weather Details**

  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Wind speed
  * Weather condition

*  **Smart Weather Tips**

  * Context-aware suggestions based on temperature and conditions.

*  **6-Day Weather Forecast**

  * Daily average temperature
  * Most frequent weather condition

*  **Air Quality Monitoring**

  * 5-day AQI forecast
  * Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO

*  **Data Visualization**

  * Line charts for weather trends
  * AQI trend visualization

*  **Database Integration (MySQL)**

  * Stores weather search history
  * Supports full CRUD operations:

    * Add
    * View
    * Update
    * Delete

*  **PDF Weather Report**

  * Downloadable weather and air quality report.

* ▶ **YouTube Weather Redirect**

  * Opens weather-related videos for searched locations.

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Streamlit** – Interactive web dashboard
* **OpenWeatherMap API** – Weather & air pollution data
* **MySQL** – Local database storage
* **Pandas** – Data processing
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **ReportLab** – PDF generation
* **Requests** – API calls

---

##  How the Application Works

1. User opens the Streamlit dashboard.
2. The app detects the user’s location and displays current weather.
3. User searches a location manually (city/zip/lat-lon).
4. Weather, forecast, and air quality data are fetched via APIs.
5. Results are visualized using charts.
6. Search details are stored in a MySQL database.
7. User can view, update, or delete previous records.
8. Weather report can be downloaded as a PDF.

##  Database Setup (Local MySQL)

This project uses a **local MySQL database** to ensure **easy reproducibility** for anyone cloning the repository.

### 1️ Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE weather_db;
```

No need to manually create tables — they are auto-generated by the app.

---

### 2️ (Optional) Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=weather_db
OPENWEATHER_API=your_openweather_api_key
```

If `.env` is not provided, the app defaults to:

* Host: `localhost`
* User: `root`
* Password: *(empty)*
* Database: `weather_db`

---

##  Installation & Setup

### 1️ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shahida1304/weather_app.git
cd weather_app
```

---

### 2️ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3️ Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

##  Security & Design Notes

* No database credentials are hardcoded.
* `.env` and SSL certificates are excluded via `.gitignore`.
* Local-first database design improves portability.
* Database layer is **cloud-ready** and can be migrated to AWS RDS or managed SQL services with minimal changes.

---

##  Future Enhancements

* User authentication & profiles
* Cloud database support (AWS RDS / Railway / PlanetScale)
* Caching API responses for performance
* Multi-language UI support
* Enhanced weather analytics dashboards

This project is intentionally designed with a **local-first database setup** to allow easy execution on any system.
The database layer is modular and can be extended to cloud environments for production use.
